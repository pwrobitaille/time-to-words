# Time to Word

Given the time in numerals (HH:MM), write a program that converts it into words.
e.g.
     * 5:00  -> five o' clock
     * 5:01  -> one minute past five
     * 4:15  -> quarter past four
     * 6:30  -> half past six
     * 11:40 -> twenty minutes to twelve
     * 1:45  -> quarter to two
     * 3:24  -> twenty four minutes past three


To run, clone down repo and run `ruby hatch.rb` from the command line
